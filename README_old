Tomboy.osx is a full implementation of Tomboy. Tomboy-library provices the backend features.
Tomboy-library[1] is another project to provide all Tomboy features by API.

This project will be merged into the main Tomboy project at git.gnome.org at some point.

Tomboy.osx is based on MonoMac and will be fully compatible with Tomboy on Linux or Windows.

Tomboy is a desktop note-taking application for Linux and Unix. Simple and
easy to use, but with potential to help you organize the ideas and
information you deal with every day.

Have you ever felt the frustration at not being able to locate a website you
wanted to check out, or find an email you found interesting, or remember an
idea about the direction of the political landscape in post-industrial
Australia? Or are you one of those desperate souls with home-made, buggy, or
not-quite-perfect notes systems?

Time for Tomboy. We bet you'll be surprised at how well a little application
can make life less cluttered and run more smoothly.
